## Scripting for Pentesting && Offensive Applications

-----

If there was one thing that OSCP drills into above all else, it is the importance of enumeration. 
During the course of my OSCP journey, I realized the importance of bash as well as scripting in general, combined with the importance of balancing thorough enumeration with efficiency. With that, I decided to create a bash script aimed at increasing the efficiency of enumeration while still maintaining a thorough application. 

It is important to note that this script is tailored for the OSCP specifically; I understand that throwing rustscan, nmap, and a suite of tools at a production environment with a vigilant blue team is not wise -- but this was built with the specific use-case of the OSCP.

The main enumeration script can be found in the following repo:
