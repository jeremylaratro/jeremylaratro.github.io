# Logic Gates


format:
a + b = output (1=power/0=no power)

NAND: 
- Either or none = power
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 0 + 0 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 0



XOR: 
 - Either but NOT none and NOT both (EXCLUSIVE or) = power
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 0
- 0 + 0 = 0
- XOR gates consist of 4 NAND gates

AND:
 - BOTH only = power
1 + 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 0

OR: 
 - Either or both (NON-exclusive OR) = power
 - 1 + 0 = 1
 - 0 + 1 = 1
 - 1 + 1 = 1
 - 0 + 0 = 1

NOT: 
 - only when NOT = power (only one input)
 0 --> 1
 1 --> 0
