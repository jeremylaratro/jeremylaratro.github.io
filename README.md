Thanks for visiting. I created this site in order to both learn about web development and document some of the work and projects I have done in the recent past. I jumped into this with almost zero knowledge of css and learned along the way, so I am constantly trying to improve the "mess" I created originally, which while works, is not organized optimally and contains some errors.
