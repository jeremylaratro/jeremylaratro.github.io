    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p><br>
        <h2>Background:</h2>
<p>
        I recently graduated from USF (August, 2022) with a BSc. in Integrative Animal Biology; this journey has been extremely productive for me both in terms of my education as well as for learning about myself. When I started USF in 2018, I, along with many others who enter university, did not have a clear picture of what I wanted to be or where I wanted to go in terms of a career. As COVID came, the time I spent at home was a blessing as it lead me to a truly deeper understanding of myself and my passions.

        During this time, I discovered Arduino, and the rest was history. The progression quickly escalated from simple Arduino concept projects into designing my own PCBs in KiCAD and having them manufactured from JLPCB and PCBWay. I learned Python, some C++ (Arduino), and also found my passion for radio; I designed and built my own high frequency (HF) antennas using simulation software like MMANA-GAL, which I used to successfully contact people as far as New Zealand, Australia, and Japan (FCC callsign, KO4DNM). I started a business refurbishing, fixing, and reselling electronics, radios, computers, and other engineering equipment like oscilloscopes, TDR meters, and so on in order to help pay for rent, food, and other expenses. These are just a few examples of the many, many projects and learning experiences that made up the past few years. It was too late to change my degree to computer science or electrical engineering without passing excess credit hours -- but my time spent finishing my degree was anything but a waste, as my education continued to help me grow academically, personally, and I also discovered my love for organic chemistry.
</p><p>
<br>
        <h2>Current:</h2>
    <p>
        Now, having graduated and having obtained my OSCP, I am looking to enter the infosec industry in an offensive security role. I quickly realized that cyber security would be a perfect career path which would merge my passion for technology and science with a societally important role, as the prevalence of threats and bad actors is ever-expanding alongside the constantly-growing integration of more and more data and sensitive information within networks.

        Below is a synopsis of my skills in relation to cyber security and computer science in general. My skills are constantly expanding, as I currently spend 8+ hours a day devoted to learning and applying the concepts which will help me to achieve my goals. I also have strong scientific writing skills, having written many, many technical documents and lab reports for my physics, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and other STEM classes.
    </p><br></br>

        <br>
    <h2>Skills, Paths, and Tools:</h2>
<p>
        My learning path for cyber security has been an array of different tools and methods. For fundamentals, I have used the Palo Alto Networks PCCET materials, alongside resources on Github, Codeacademy, ISC2, and Udemy.

        I currently hold the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certificate and keep active accounts with a number of web-based learning platforms. I've completed over 50 rooms on TryHackMe (currently in the top 2% of users) and have started double that (some things I simply took the information I needed for the sake of efficiency). I regularly partake in capture the flag exercises and am extremely active on OffSec's Proving Grounds, which is like a CTF platform, but uses only real-world vulnerabilities, giving me the opportunity to have hands on experience with popular CVE's and other vulnerabilities.
<br>
        Practically, I am well-versed with both Pytho and Linux, having used Ubuntu as my daily OS for ~2 years, and I am also comfortable with other Debian-based distros, specifically Parrot OS (mainly) and Kali, which I have installed dual-boot for my cyber security learning. I am extremely comfortable with Python and have contributed to a few different open source projects, including a security-focused photo utility tool as well as creating an interactive CLI with various features, including bulk input and text/csv file output, for an organic chemistry application which converts IUPAC names to SMILE strings and vice-versa. I am also comfortable with HTML and CSS; I created a portfolio/project website via Github Pages and AWS Route55 which I created myself using CSS, HTML, and a bit of javascript (jeremylaratro.link - not entirely mobile-friendly yet). I am also comfortable with using Jupyter Notebooks, which I have employed in some of my projects as well as in my school courses for data science.

        I have also been familiarizing myself and using various cybersecurity-related tools, including (but not limited to) nmap, netcat, metasploit framework, powershell, hashcat, wpscan, gobuster, sqlmap, ffuf, hydra, wireshark, burp suite, aircrack-ng, binwalk, exiftools, sqsh, smbclient, ftp, rpcclient, all of which I have used in practical applications for the OSCP and on TryHackMe, picoctf, HackTheBox, BurpSuite Academy, and other ethical practice applications. </br>
</p>

     <br>   <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>
    I recently obtained my OSCP and would like to pursue other certifications to further prove my skills and further my career. I really enjoy netpen, hardware hacking, IoT, and embedded systems, so would love to pursue a path in one of those specializations. I'd love to get my OSEP to start and I'm on the lookout for a good way of getting into embedded systems security.

        My path may not be the most typical one, but I know that my evolving skills and extreme desire to constantly learn, in combination with my STEM knowledge, are a valuable asset and a fit for the cybersecurity or electrical engineering industries.

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        Something that I really value in life is the endless amount of things to do and in turn being a well-rounded person by diversifying hobbies, skills, and interests. I don't believe in the "pick one thing and stick to it" philosophy.
        I strongly believe that diversified interests greatly help a person grow and learn about themselves, and if responsibly managed and scheduled, a person can do a near-endless amount of things in a lifetime.
        <br> </br>
        <br>Aside from cybersecurity, I also am involved with a bunch of other hobbies.
    <h3> Scuba Diving </h3>
    <p>
    I regularly scuba dive all throughout Florida and have also dived in various other countries. I'm an open-water and nitrox (I can use up to 40% oxygen in my dive gas mixture, which can reduce risk of DCS and extend bottom/frequency time by lowering nitrogen loading) certified diver through SSI.
Some of the places that I've been diving include:
        <br>
        <br>- Florida - Keys: Duck Key</br>
        <br>- Florida - Gulf Coast: Clearwater (Veteran's Reef, three barges), Venice (fossil-hunting dive), Tarpon Springs (Ledge dives)</br>
        <br>- Florida - East Coast: Jupiter - (Area 51, Loggerhead Reef), West Palm Beach</br>
        <br>- St. Croix</br>
        <br>- I currently have a drive trip to Mexico planned for the summer of 2023!</br>
     <p>   </br>

    <h3> Hiking </h3>
        <p>
        I regularly hike within Florida's state and local parks. I enjoy getting up early and getting to a park just before sunset, starting a 5-10 mile hike as the sun rises overhead. The Florida
            Wetlands are beautiful and a unique ecosystem, and I'm grateful to be able to drive just a short while and see some of these amazing parks. I can't wait to explore more parks throughout the US,
            especially out west with the mountains and deciduous forests.

    <h3> Photography </h3>
            <p>
            Photography goes hand-in-hand with hiking for me. I really enjoy going out in nature and capturing unique moments. Most of my photography is nature related, especially with landscapes and wildlife (birds are my favorite!).
                I also enjoy doing macro photography, although I don't have a proper macro setup at the moment, along with drone/aerial photography, and most recently, I have begun doing real estate photography to make
                some extra money.

    <h3> Aviation </h3>
               <p>
               I've always had an interest in aviation but I never really viewed it as anything other than something I would do in the simulator. This changed, however, recently when I decided to do a discovery flight with my local flight school.
                   Getting my private pilot's license (PPL) is going to be one of my first non-work related goals once I am able to save up some money!

    <br>
    <p>
        I created this site using mostly HTML and CSS. The site is hosted by Github pages and the domain is routed via
        AWS (Route55).
        I plan to post more projects as I have time, and update the site as my understanding and skills improve.
